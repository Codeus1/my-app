-- Create demo user in Supabase Auth
-- Note: This should be done via Supabase dashboard or API since SQL can't directly insert into auth.users
-- For now, we'll create a note that the user needs to sign up via the registration page first

-- Alternative: Use the registration page to create the demo user
-- Or use Supabase dashboard to create a user with:
-- Email: demo@salespro.com
-- Password: demo123

-- For development purposes, we recommend:
-- 1. Go to /auth/register
-- 2. Register with email: demo@salespro.com and password: demo123
-- 3. Verify the email (Supabase will send a verification email)
-- 4. Once verified, you can log in

-- This script is a placeholder to document the demo credentials
-- In production, you would use Supabase Admin API to create users programmatically
